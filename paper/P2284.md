# Motivation and Scope
State Machines are fundamental aspect of computer sience and are wildy used in the industry.
There are many aspects to consider when implementing a state machine framwork, and a good standard library can ease the burden for developers.

# Terminology
State Machine means different things to different people.
This sectoin sets the terminology for the rest of the paper.

## FSM
FSM is a Finite State Machine. It encapsulates everything this proposal suggests.<br>
The facility this paper proposed is called fsm.
```cpp
std::fsm my_fsm;
```
A FSM has the following responsibilities:<br>
* Holds its states 
* Holds a common context for all states
* Transit between states.

## State
A State is a position in the state machine. The state machine itself can rest, at a given time, only in a single state.

## Transition
A Transition is the move of the state machine from one state to another.

## Context
The context of a state machine is the common data or functionality that is accesible to all states.


```cpp
    fsm::state wait_for_input("wait-for-input");
    fsm::state open("open");
    fsm::state locked("locked");	
	
	int retries = 3;
    
    fsm::transition(
		wait_for_input, // when in this state
		// do the following when the input is std::string
		[](const std::string password) -> std::fsm::state&
		{			
			if (fsm::context_v > 3) // quering the context
				{return locked;}
            if (password_ok(password)) // cheking the input
			   {return open;}
            ++fsm::context_v;	// changing the context
            return wait_for_input;
        }
    // constrcu an fsm with int as the common context
    std::fsm<int> myfsm(retries);
```

```plantuml
@startuml

!pragma layout smetana

[*] --> Idle
Idle --> [*]
Idle : do nothing wait for issues

Idle -> Development : issue
Development -> Idle
Development -> [*] : resign

# Open Issues
* Completeness: should all states handle all inputs?
** Yes: it is safer, it covers all possible situations.
** No: it is just too much effort from the developer point of view to force declarig handling of impossible combinations of state/input.
* Explicit and enforced states transitions vs. implicit and non enforced state transition
