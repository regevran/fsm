after ./run, inside the docker, make sure
that you have a symbolic link to paper/P2284.md
with the name P2284.md (i.e P2284.md -> paper/P2284.md)
and then run:
# make P2284.pdf

without this make will fail.
From some reason git refuses to store this symbolic link in its repository.
No time to investigate the reason at the moment.
